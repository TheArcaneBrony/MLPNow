## What's this site?

A simple web page that displays the date and time accoring to the user's preferences.

### Sounds pretty basic, why all the fuss?

This project was created around the summer of 2012 and has hit a lot of rough edges such as switching domains, and ultimately ended up to being abandoned by me. On the 28th of October in 2015, I decided to go back to my roots, to the very first project that got me into programming, and using what I've learned throughout the years that have passed since I hope to create something I didn't have the knowledge for back then.

## Obligatory attribution

A lot of the code you see here is taken from my most active project to date, [MLPVC-RR](https://github.com/ponydevs/MLPVC-RR). If you're interested in something more "practical" than a clock, have a look at that instead.
